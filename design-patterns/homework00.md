Task: bring back relationships in life and their formal characteristics.  

List of them, and their formal properties. Eg 

  - Part of 
  - Believes 
  - desires 

Prior to next meeting please send me at least 2 relations you've identified and answers to the following questions:

Is this relation reflexive, i.e. for every x is xRx

Is this relation irreflexive, i.e. no x is such that xRx

Is this relation symmetric, i.e. for every x and y, if xRy then yRx

Is this relation antisymmetric, i.e. for every x and y, if xRy and yRx then x=y

Is this relation asymmetric, i.e. for every x and y, if xRy then it is not the case that yRx

Is this relation functional, i.e. for every x, y and z, if xRy and xRz then y=z

Is this relation inverse functional, i.e. for every x, y, z, if xRy and zRy then x=z

Is this relation transitive, i.e. for every x, y, and z, if xRy and yRz then xRz
