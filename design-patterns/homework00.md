Prior to next meeting please send me at least 2 relations you've identified and answers to the following questions:
  - Is this relation reflexive, i.e. for every x is xRx
  - Is this relation irreflexive, i.e. no x is such that xRx
  - Is this relation symmetric, i.e. for every x and y, if xRy then yRx
  - Is this relation antisymmetric, i.e. for every x and y, if xRy and yRx then x=y
  - Is this relation asymmetric, i.e. for every x and y, if xRy then it is not the case that yRx
  - Is this relation functional, i.e. for every x, y and z, if xRy and xRz then y=z
  - Is this relation inverse functional, i.e. for every x, y, z, if xRy and zRy then x=z
  - Is this relation transitive, i.e. for every x, y, and z, if xRy and yRz then xRz

assumptions: 
 - "in life" and lower-case variables imply instances/particulars, not classes/universals
 - "in life" and upper-case variable R implies
