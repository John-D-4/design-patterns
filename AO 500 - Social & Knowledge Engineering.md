Course Description
------------------

The goal of this course is train presentation and preparation skills as applied to the domain of knowledge engineering. This includes factors which affect social influence, the underlying mechanisms for them, how they are applied in real world situations. To this end, the course will provide evidence-based drills to practice leveraging body language, metaphor, rhyming, tone, and ideological convictions to persuade small and large audiences. The aim of this course is for you to leave a more competent, confident, and polished presenter, as well as an informed critic of those charmers in the world attempting to persuade you.

Grading Policy
--------------

  **Weighting**   **Assessment/Assignment**
  --------------- ---------------------------
  30%             Participation
  40%             Drills
  15%             Midterm Presentation
  15%             Final Presentation

*Drill Assignments*

Drill assignments will be assigned during the course. You are encouraged
to work with your classmates on these assignments. The drills will be
tailored to your particular presentation weaknesses, as evaluated by the
instructor. You will be evaluated based on your ability to make progress
on addressing those weaknesses during the drill assignment. Assignments
will be due **at the beginning of class on the Monday of the week that
they are assigned** unless otherwise specified. Drills will be submitted
to the instructor via email. **Late drill assignments will not be
accepted**.

*Attendance and Participation*

In my experience, attendance is vital to mastering the material covered
during this course. With that in mind, I require students attend each
class session, and incorporate this requirement into each student's
grade. There are two components to the grade: attendance and
participation.

With respect to attendance, you are allowed to **miss two sessions**
without penalty and without an excuse.

With respect to participation, I intend to follow the rubric below:

-   90-100% - Regularly contribute to class discussions with insightful
    and relevant comments. Engage constructively with peers.

-   80-89% - Frequently participates in class discussions. Shows a good
    understanding of course material.

-   70-79% - Participates in class but contributions are less frequent.
    Understands basic concepts but does not demonstrate good
    understanding of the course material.

-   60-69% - Rarely participates in class discussions. Contributions
    show minimal understanding of the course content.

-   0-59% - Does not participate in class discussions or contributions
    are off-topic or disruptive. Shows little to no understanding or
    engagement with the course material.

Accordingly, it will serve you well to be prepared to discuss the course
content when you arrive each day, that is, complete the assignments, and
be ready to engage in discussions.

Students may have valid reasons for missing classes, including military
duties, religious commitments, health issues verified by a physician or
qualified healthcare provider, among other things. You must inform me at
least 48 hours in advance via email, when feasible. I will determine
what constitutes a fair amount of work to compensate for your absence.

*Midterm Presentation*

The cumulative midterm presentation will consist of a presentation on a
topic of your choosing that has been accepted by the instructor as
acceptable. Each student is required to complete the midterm
presentation. This may take the form of a video or in-class
presentation. If the former, then the midterm presentation will be due
**at the beginning of class on the Monday of the week that it is
assigned** and will be submitted to the instructor via email. If the
latter, then the midterm presentation must be given no later than the
last day of class. The midterm presentation **will not be accepted after
the deadline**.

*Final Pattern*

The cumulative final presentation will consist of a presentation on a
topic of your choosing that has been accepted by the instructor as
acceptable. Each student is required to complete the final presentation
assignment. Students are encouraged to revise and incorporate content
from their midterm presentation and drill assignments submitted earlier
in the course for their final presentation. This may take the form of a
video or in-class presentation. If the former, then the final
presentation will be due **at the beginning of class on the Monday of
the week that it is assigned** and will be submitted to the instructor
via email. If the latter, then the final presentation must be given no
later than the last day of class. The final presentation **will not be
accepted after the deadline**.

*Incompletes*

A grade of incomplete ("I") indicates that additional course work is
required to fulfill the requirements of a given course. Students may
only be given an "I" grade if they have a passing average in coursework
that has been completed and have well-defined parameters to complete the
course requirements that could result in a grade better than the default
grade. An "I" grade may not be assigned to a student who did not attend
the course. Prior to the end of the semester, students must initiate the
request for an "I" grade and receive the instructor's approval.
Assignment of an "I" grade is at the discretion of the instructor.
